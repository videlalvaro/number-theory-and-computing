        <h2><a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Readings in Number Theory and Computing</h2>

        <p>Inspired
        by <a href="http://christophermeiklejohn.com/distributed/systems/2013/07/12/readings-in-distributed-systems.html">this</a>
        page by <a href="https://twitter.com/cmeik/">@cmeik</a> I've
        decided to create my own list of readings about Mathematics,
        specifically about Number Theory and Computing.</p>

        <p>What I've found interesting about Number Theory is that
        since it mostly deals with Integer Numbers, its consequences
        are quite easy to <em>see</em>. Besides, Number Theory is
        widely used for Cryptography, Random Number Generators and
        more, so it's quite interesting to at least have an idea of
        what it is about.</p>

        <h3><a name="books" class="anchor" href="#books"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Books</h3>

        <p>Some of the books are purely theoretical, but most of them
        have direct applications in computing. I don't claim to have
        read all these books, but I have read several chapters or
        sections on each of them.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Numbers-G-Hardy/dp/0199219869/">An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers</a></dt>
          <dd>Hardy, G. H., and Edward Maitland Wright. 2008 (First
          ed. 1938). This is basically THE book on Number Theory. The
          style is very dry, it was written back in 1938 but it will
          guide you through almost every theorem in Number
          Theory. This is a mostly theoretical book.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Sciences-Prentice-Hall-automatic-computation/dp/0130392227/">Applied algebra for the computer sciences</a></dt>
          <dd>Gill, Arthur. 1976. This is an old book, but quite
          juicy. It touches a lot of topics, like boolean algebra,
          sets, groups, rings and fields, error correcting codes and
          even graph theory. Today you can find it mostly second hand, so it's
          rather cheap.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://shoup.net/ntb/">A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra</a></dt>
          <dd>Shoup, Victor. 2008. I'm really happy with this
          book. The explanations for the various topics are quite
          clear and easy to follow. You also learn about the actual
          applications of these theories. Also
          the <em>computational</em> part on the title already tells
          us that there are lot of algorithms in this book. The
          complexity of the running time of the algorithms is analyzed
          as well.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Numbers-A-Computational-Perspective/dp/0387252827/">Prime numbers: a computational perspective</a></dt>
          <dd>Crandall, Richard E., and Carl Pomerance. 2005. This is
          a very well presented book on the practicalities of Prime
          Numbers, mostly with their application to cryptography. One
          of the authors was the chief cryptographer at Apple, while
          the other author has many theorems under his name.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Groups-Symmetry-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387966757/">Groups and symmetry</a></dt>
          <dd>Armstrong, M. A. 1988. This book presents Group Theory
          and Symmetry for an undergraduate level, so it's quite easy
          to follow and a nice intro for the other, more advanced
          books. Lots of pictures an examples as well.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Permutation-Groups-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387945997/">Permutation groups</a></dt>
          <dd>Dixon, John D., and Brian Mortimer. 1996. A more
          advanced introduction to Permutation Groups.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Computational-Discrete-Mathematics-Applications/dp/1584883723/">Handbook of computational group theory</a></dt>
          <dd>Holt, Derek F., Bettina Eick, and Eamonn
          A. O'Brien. 2005. This book is really great. Its first
          chapter lays out the basics about group theory in a very
          nice and easy to follow manner. This is quite nice, since
          once you start going to the more advanced chapters you
          actually know what the authors are talking about. Each
          chapter ends with a section on the applications of what you
          have just read, so that's a nice thing to have.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Course-Number-Cryptography-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0387942939/">A course in number theory and cryptography</a></dt>
          <dd>Koblitz, Neal. 1987. This books explains most of the early cryptography and computing techniques and has an intro to elliptic curves.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-RijndaeL-Encryption-Information-Cryptography/dp/3540425802/">The design of Rijndael: AES -- the Advanced Encryption Standard</a></dt>
          <dd>Daemen, Joan, and Vincent Rijmen. 2002. This book is a
          must have. It explains the design of AES and it really shows
          how some areas of mathematics that look quite abstract and not so useful
          can be applied to design an algorithm like this
          one.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Concrete-Mathematics-Foundation-Computer-Science/dp/0201558025/">Concrete mathematics: a foundation for computer science</a></dt>
          <dd>Graham, Ronald L., Donald Ervin Knuth, and Oren
          Patashnik. 1989. This book is a very good companion to
          TAOCP, giving a more detailed intro to the mathematics used
          in TAOCP</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Delight-2nd-Henry-Warren/dp/0321842685/">Hacker's
          Delight</a></dt>
          <dd>Warren, Henry S. 2012. The interesting thing about this
          book is that it touches a lot of topics that are related to
          numbers and computing and how they are actually implemented
          in a computer, with limited RAM, limited word sizes and so
          on. The Number Theory of the previous books is nice, but
          this book shows how the actual CPU architecture plays a very
          important role in this kind of numeric algorithms.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Computer-Programming-Seminumerical-Algorithms/dp/0201896842/">The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 2, Seminumerical algorithms</a></dt>
          <dd>Knuth, Donald Ervin. 1998. This massive volume by Knuth
          explains many of the algorithms related with numbers as the
          title shows. From how random number generators works, to
          working with different radixes, up to all kinds of
          algorithms related to polynomials.</dd>

        <p>I haven't read that many papers on the topic, since I have
        focused mostly on learning from books. Nonetheless here are a
        couple of interesting papers on Group Theory</p>
